== Introduction
The main goal of `Layoutalgorithms` is to tell a `LayoutContainer` where to position it's children. It does this by implementing a set of methods with the following functionality:

. measuring
. positioning
. validating
. mapping positions to depths

The measuring and positioning of the children are done in two steps; horizontally and vertically. This way it's easy to combine two layout-algorithms to create a new algortihm.

== Float's
=== Horizontal float

.Left-to-right
{sys:build/doc-include "diagrams/Algorithm_HorFloat_LtR.ditaa"}

[horizontal]
`a-d`:: LayoutClient's
`E`:: LayoutContainer - HorizontalFloat(left-to-right)

.Right-to-left
{sys:build/doc-include "diagrams/Algorithm_HorFloat_RtL.ditaa"}

[horizontal]
`a-d`:: LayoutClient's
`E`:: LayoutContainer - HorizontalFloat(right-to-left)

=== Vertical float
{sys:build/doc-include "diagrams/Algorithm_VerFloat.ditaa"}

=== Diagonal Float
`Dynamic(horizontal-float, vertical-float)`
{sys:build/doc-include "diagrams/Algorithm_DiagonalFloat.ditaa"}

== Circle
`Dynamic(horizontal-circle, vertical-circle)`
{sys:build/doc-include "diagrams/Algorithm_Circle.ditaa"}

.Properties
. equal width/height values
. no measuring, uses explicit-size properties

=== Horizontal circle
Algorithm responsible for positioning the x-coordinates in a circle. Results in a a sinus if you combine it with a vertical-float-algorithm.

=== Vertical circle

== Dynamic
Dynamic algorithm combines two sub-algorithms (1 horizontal and 1 vertical) to create new ways of positioning layout-children.

== Relative
Relative algorithm uses the relative values of a child to position it within the parent. In CSS2 the relative position is applied after a box has been laid out according to the normal flow. With relative-algorithm you can't combine these to layout-algorithms.

The relative values of a `LayoutClient` are stored in `LayoutClient.relative` using a `Box`

NOTE: add references to class-documentation.

.Properties
[options="header", cols="1m,2,6"]
|=====
|Property 	|Direction	|Details
|top		|vertical	|Number of `px` between top-side of parent and the top-side of the child
|bottom		|vertical	|Number of `px` between bottom-side of parent and the bottom-side of the child
|v-center	|vertical	|Number of `px` the vertical between vertical-center of parent and the vertical-center of the child
|left		|horizontal	|Number of `px` between left-side of parent and the left-side of the child
|right		|horizontal	|Number of `px` between right-side of parent and the right-side of the child
|h-center	|horizontal	|Number of `px` between horizontal-center of parent and the horizontal-center of the child
|=====

- Using only one horizontal or vertical property will affect only the x- or y-coordinate
- Combining `top` and `bottom`, or `left` and `right`, will also affect the `width`/`height`
- Setting `v-center` will unset the values for `bottom` and `top`. Idem with setting `h-center` and `left` and `right`

.Horizontal Example
[options="header", cols="1m,1m,1m,1m,1m,3m"]
|=====
|parent-width	|child-width	|left	|h-center	|right	|result
|100px			|40px			|5px	|NaN		|NaN	|x=5px, width=40px
|100px			|40px			|NaN	|NaN		|15px	|x=(100-40-15)=45px, width=40px
|100px			|40px			|10px	|NaN		|15px	|x=10px, width=(100-15-10)=75px
|100px			|40px			|NaN	|0px		|NaN	|x=(100-40)/2=30px, width=40px
|100px			|40px			|NaN	|10px		|NaN	|x=(100-40)/2+10=40px, width=40px
|100px			|40px			|NaN	|-10px		|NaN	|x=(100-40)/2-10=20px, width=40px

== Tiles
Currently there are 3 tiling-layout-algorithms, basicly they all position the children in rows/columns until a row/column is full and then continue on new row/column. Each algorithm allows you to specify the start-direction (`horizontal` or `vertical`).

=== Simple Tile
This algorithm is the most straight forward and simple tile-algorithm. It will position the children in rows (`horizontal`) or in columns (`vertical) and tries to put as many children as posible one row/column.

.Properties
. Only support left-to-right or top-to-bottom directions
. all cells in a row have the same y-coordinate (horizontal direction) or all cells in a column have the same x-coordinate (vertical direction)
. iterates all children when re-validating the layout

{sys:build/doc-include "diagrams/Algorithm_Tile.ditaa"}


=== Fixed-Tile
Fixed-tile-algorithm uses a fixed number of columns (or rows if the start direction is vertical) to position it's children instead of trying to put as many children as possible in a row/column. The algorithm will position the children like a table, it uses the heighest cell in a row to define the row-height and widest cell in a column to define to column-width.

.Properties
. support `left-to-right`, `right-to-left`, `top-to-bottom` and `bottom-to-top` directions
. only iterates rows/columns which have children that are changed when re-validating the layout
. all cells in a row have the same y-coordinate
. all cells in a column have the same x-coordinate
. smart but not light-weight

NOTE: This algorithm has the highest performance-cost of the three, even though the algorithm will only update rows and columns that are changed.

=== Dynamic-Tile
Dynamic-tile-algorithm is a combination between `fixed-tile` and `simple-tile`. Internally it works the same way as `fixed-tile` except that the number of columns (or rows) is *dynamic* and based on the measured/explicit size of the layout-container. This also means the number of children in a row can differ per row.

.Properties
. support `left-to-right`, `right-to-left`, `top-to-bottom` and `bottom-to-top` directions
. only iterates rows/columns which have children that are changed when re-validating the layout
. all cells in a row have the same y-coordinate (horizontal direction) or all cells in a column have the same x-coordinate (vertical direction)
. smart but not light-weight
